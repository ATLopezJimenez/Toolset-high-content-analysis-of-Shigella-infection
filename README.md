SHIGELLA INFECTION HIGH CONTENT

This repository holds ImageJ macros and python code written by Ana Teresa López Jiménez in Serge Mostowy's lab (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine). They were used to identify and analyse SEPT7 recruitment to Shigella flexneri as presented in the preprint submitted for peer-review:

"High-content superresolution microscopy and deep learning assisted analysis reveals host and bacterial heterogeneity during Shigella infection". Ana T. López-Jiménez, Dominik Brokatzky, Kamla Pillay, Tyrese Williams, Gizem Özbaykal Güler and Serge Mostowy (2024)

Description of each individual item is here below:

1. ImageJ macro: "segmentation_bacteria_squarecrop"
     This macro segments rod shaped bacteria based on fluorescence, and then saves a square crop of the bacteria with additional channels and the segmented mask.
     This macro is to be used to generate images to train a CNN or to be classified by a trained CNN.
